<blockquote>
Welcome to the CVDNN (Computer Vision and Deep Neural Network) Lab! The CVDNN Lab. is a research laboratory created in 2022, and is headed by Professor Sang-Geol Lee.

We study a variety of deep neural network models for image data. We also study various fields of computer vision, such as semantic image analysis, image understanding, and image generation based on the DNN model.
